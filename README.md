# Five-Night-s-At-Freddy-s-8Bits
The first game I made in GML (and not in Yacc D: ), based on FnaF 1, in BETA and not finished but I will release an other one with new cool things

So I made a Fnaf-like inspired by the pizzaria from the first game. The view is only the camera but you'll have to place your mouse over the (real)
cameras on screen to use the battery and look for the moving animatronics.

The door can be shut with Q (for the left) and D (for the right)

only the mouse , Q and D are used

have fun :)
